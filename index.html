      <h2>Chess "Knight" Game</h2>
      <div class="img-chess" ></div>

      <p>~ Made after I took my first course in Java, creating this game posed quite a challenge. Combining my knowledge of class structure and combining it with an interactive interface was one of my most challenging and rewarding experiences. The object of the game is to move the knight to every square, without repeating. It is quite a bit harder than it looks and people have even made a whole wikipedia on how to solve it.

      <h2>LAB Visualizer</h2>
      <div class="img-lab" ></div>
      <p>~ Created a program in Python during my summer internship to better visualize LAB color readings. These color readings are used to determine whether a part sample and a color sample are close enough in color for consumer needs. These color readings can then be used to calculate a single value, which then tells you if the color difference between two objects is perceptable to the human eye.

      <h2>Snapchat "Data Visualizer"</h2>
      <div class="img-snapchat" ></div>
      <p>~ With what I learned from creating a chess game, I took on the challenge of visualizing large sets of data in this project. Using downloadable data from Snapchat, this program creates unique color sets for every user who has sent you a snap within a two month period. You can now see in vivid color how few friends you have.
